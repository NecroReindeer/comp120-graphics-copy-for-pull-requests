##COMP120 Tinkering Graphics Project
Source code contained within exhibit.py.
I have not used JES, instead I have used normal Python and [Pillow](https://python-pillow.github.io/).

Tile effect currently takes a very long time, and is currently the first effect to run. It takes about a minute before any pictures appear.

###Additional Libraries Used:

Pillow -https://python-pillow.github.io/

###Source Images Used:

**jegermeister.jpg** TrollfesT JegerMeister T-shirt design (I can't find the image online anymore)

**sad.jpg** Image made by me
